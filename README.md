# Library Management System
This project is a small website that allows you to monitor your books, track profits and gains from selling and renting books, all through a simple and visually appealing interface.

# Project Overview
This Library Management System is built using Python (Flask), SQL, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to manage their books and keep track of sales and rentals. The website provides a clear visualization of your book inventory and related financial data.

# Technologies Used
Backend: Python (Flask)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Database: SQL
DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible

# Docker
Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments. A Docker container includes everything the application needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

# GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions automates, customizes, and executes software development workflows right in your repository. We use it for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), enabling automated testing, building, and deployment.

# Terraform
Terraform is used to create an EC2 instance on AWS, providing infrastructure as code. This allows us to define and provision the infrastructure in a safe and repeatable way.

# Ansible
Ansible is employed for configuration management, automating the deployment and configuration of software on our EC2 instance.
